# Getting Started with Ocean
Ocean is a program and a project.
The server running Ocean, which is open to the public on the Internet, is called an **instance**.
To use Ocean, you need to create an account in one of the instances and use that instance.

You can select an instance of your choice from the [instance list](../instances.md).

::: tip
No matter which instance you choose, you will be able to interact with users on other instances.

::: details
Ocean has the ability to federate.

Ocean has built-in federation support, which allows users in different instances to follow, react, and renote in the same way as users on the same instance.

Ocean's federation is based on an open common standard called ActivityPub, and is compatible with other software such as Mastodon and Pleroma.

## Choosing an Instance
### Instance Themes
Some instances may have a specific theme, for example, "I like certain stuff and activities".
It is recommended to find an instance of the theme that suits you best.
